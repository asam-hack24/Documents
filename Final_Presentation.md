# Introduction

## Nature Article
* Highlighted slack as a new collaboration tool for scientists
* Other currently used tools are gchat, skype and email 
* In terms of chat/video comms clients - skype, gchat and slack are popular and the alternative is email
* Email audit trails are hard to follow with multiple topics combined and doe not provide a real time interface
* While chat clients have the audit trails, it is not possible to share correctly formatted equations, compiled code scripts which could render graphs
 
## US
* Everyone in our team is a scientist and we have been exposed to the challenges of collaborating in the scientific community within the UK and globally

## Our tool benefits
### Real time chat client with multiple channels
* Could have one dedicated as a lab notebook or collaboration for a specific paper

### multiple editors  Text, Python, R, LaTeX and images. 
* This also allows for easier collaboration across scientific communities (for example, R is preferred in biological sciences while Python is preferred in Physics)
* Formulae from the different editors is automatically rendered in the sent message

### Clear audit trail 
* This is provided as every message has a name and datetime stamp. 
* This also ensure that assigning credit to the correct contributors is easy to do.

### Real time collaboration on graphs
* Graphs that are rendered with a particular editor (i.e. Python or R) can be clicked on and the source code is displayed. 
* It is then possible to update variables and see the effects on the graph
* Note that the modified graph is displayed while the old graph is still maintained in the audit trail

### Export Functionality
* It is possible to export all chat history in a channel to Jupyter notebooks (exclusive python and R can be exported separately)
 * This can be passed to publishers and used as internal lab books
 
## Features for the future
* There are many more features that can be added to enhance the tool such as :
### Validating results
* Add a "thumbs up" feature to graphs/images/equations/ etc. which indicates a concensus of people in the chat that it is the correct solution

### Security layer 
* Limit users to certain channels only

### Channel notifications
* Notify if a channel has new messages or if someone has joined/left the channel

### Version linking
* Link several version of the same graphs/equations such that it is easy to scroll between them 

### Chat selection
* Allow for specific chat items to be selected for export/copying into another channel

### Editor persistence 
* Enhance the tool such that clicking a chat item does not erase the editor contents
